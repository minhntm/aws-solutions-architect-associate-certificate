### Sumary:
- IAM is universal. It does not apply to regions at this time
- The "root account" is simply the account created when first setup your AWS account. It has complete Admin access
- New Users have No permissions when first created
- New Users are assigned **Access Key ID** & **Secret Access Keys** when first created
- Cannot use **Access key ID** & **Secret Access Key** to Login in to the console. Can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line
- If you lose **Access key ID** and **Secret Access Key**, you have to regenerate them
- Always setup Multi-factor Authentication on your root account (Google Authenticator)
- Can create and customise your own password rotation policies
